# Backend development

The first implemented slice is the session registry/identity and SQLite store.
Core remains an ASP.NET-free .NET library; there is no runnable Server or UI yet.

## Prerequisite and commands

Install the exact SDK declared in `source/global.json` without changing that pin
just to match another machine. SDK **10.0.403** is a stable .NET 10 LTS servicing
release; Microsoft's channel metadata lists active support through 2028-11-14.
It supports this slice's `net10.0` target. No bootstrap/install script is provided.

Run from `source/`, because SDK selection follows the working directory:

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\dev\repos\urd\source' # or your own copy's source directory
$dotnet = 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' # adjust for your SDK installation
$env:DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT = '1' # this terminal/child processes only
$env:MSBUILDDISABLENODEREUSE = '1'
& $dotnet --version # must print the global.json pin
& $dotnet restore Urd.slnx --locked-mode --disable-parallel -m:1 -nodeReuse:false
& $dotnet test Urd.slnx --no-restore --configuration Release --disable-build-servers -m:1 -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

Normal restore is locked and must not change the committed `packages.lock.json`
files. A mismatch fails instead of silently upgrading. Restore needs public NuGet
access or already cached packages; it does not require personal credentials.
Test also builds Core/tests with nullable checking and compiler warnings as errors.
The command avoids persistent build/compiler servers and limits build parallelism.

`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` **10.0.14** follows the stable .NET 10 provider line and
includes its SQLite native bundle. Tests use xUnit **2.9.3**'s ordinary `[Fact]` /
`Assert` API, runner **4.0.1** (supports xUnit v2 and .NET 8+) and Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
**18.11.0** (.NET 8+ assets). Versions live only at their project references; lockfiles
retain the transitive graph and content hashes. No central version layer is needed yet.

For an intentional reviewed dependency update only, edit the project reference and
regenerate both locks from `source/` with:

```powershell
& $dotnet restore Urd.slnx --force-evaluate -p:RestoreLockedMode=false --disable-parallel -m:1 -nodeReuse:false
& $dotnet restore Urd.slnx --locked-mode --disable-parallel -m:1 -nodeReuse:false
```

Review the lock changes and run tests before committing. Do not disable locked mode
for ordinary builds. SDK maintenance is a separate explicit `global.json` edit.

## Outputs and data

Normal generated `bin/`, `obj/` and test results stay inside the repository and are
ignored. NuGet uses its standard package cache. Tests own disposable temporary
SQLite directories; they must not open personal sessions, credentials or copy `data/`.
Build/test never resets application data. No clean, package or activation workflow
is implemented by this slice. During coordinated agent work, restore/build/test
must acquire, start and release the exact exclusive resource `urd:dotnet`.
